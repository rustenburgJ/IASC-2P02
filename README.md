## Bio (About me)

- I am a third-year student in Interactive Arts and Science at [Brock University](https://brocku.ca/humanities/humanities-research/humanities-research/humanities-research-institute), in the Centre for Digital Humanities. I am studying solving problems through Interactive Arts and Science. Previously my studies included Computer Science (2003), Honours Sociology with a concentration in Social Justice and Equity (2010), Honours Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies (2015). These disciplines have provided tools and lenses for analysis from hard science and soft science perspectives as well as feminist perspectives.

- I first worked in UNIX when I was the help desk for a free net in the mid 1990s. The Internet was non-graphical at first and I worked using the command line to add users to the system, make help files to instruct business and residential clients. I configured how to connect to the Internet with various computers, modems, and software, and how to use/surf non-graphical Internet programs such as Archie, Veronica, and Lynx. I prorammed at the Windows command line (DOS) since 1988 and in Java since 1997 at school and on my G5 Powerbook, Macbooks, and Windows OS. I also use my two Linux OS computers.

- My interests are social justice and equity, programming, Arduino, and I have a You Tube gaming channel. I volunteer making meals, serving and cleaning up for a Saturday Lunch Program in my community for low income and homeless people.
