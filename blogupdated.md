### Traditional Analysis of Texts

Social scientists use a variety of techniques (e.g., surveys, experiments) to help them “see” the social world (Brym: 525). At first most [social scientists and policymakers] believed that the Internet would enhance equality of access to information by reducing its cost. As technoeuphoria wore off, however, observers noted that some kinds of people used the Internet more than others and that those with higher access also had greater access to education, income, and other resources that help people get ahead (DiMaggio: 549).
Higher education “has always been closely related to social-class background” (Brym: 328). At one Canadian university “students [e.g., women, Jews, Ukranians, Poles, Dutch, Norwegians, Germans, Italians, and Mennonites at the University of Manitoba] needed much higher marks than the “preferred” students [who] were Anglo-Celtic Protestant and Catholic (Brym: 329).
Conflict theory views society as a site of struggle between groups with different kinds and amounts of power and resources…Groups with more power are likely to control schooling and to impose their culture on it (Brym: 322).
“Conflict analysis draws attention to the question of whose knowledge is reflected in schools, and which groups are served by the norms that schools foster” (Brym: 323). “Schools, like the society, are controlled by the relatively powerful, educational change depends on change in relations of power outside the school system” (Brym: 324).
Unequal power relations result in economic inequality, class difference, and dominance through schooling for people.

##  Race and Gender Inequalities--A Hierarchy of Race and Gender
“Humans … naturally favour members of their own ethnic or racial group—their ‘relatives’—and have a natural distrust and dislike of ‘nonfamily’ members” (Brym: 221).
“Power, prestige, and material well-being are often interrelated…historically, women have been excluded from certain types of activities that create opportunities for acquiring power, prestige, and wealth” (Brym: 190). 

##  Feminism described as first, second, and third waves. 

For the purpose of this article I am conflating feminism into three waves in order to remind us of the connections of race, gender, and the academy. The first wave of feminism (Henslin et al., 2007: 153) was the fight for the right to vote; the primary goal was the struggle to grant to vote to middle class women, 1835-1920 (Crowe: 59, 60). The second wave of feminism, the rise of feminism in the mid 1960s along with other movements including the civil rights movement in the United States (Crow: 59). The third wave of feminism, late 1980s, 1990-1999 (Crow, 2009: 37, 59) brought out, uncovered, “the recognition that Canadian social institutions perpetuate racism” … and led to “epistemological questions of how to theorize the inter-connection between race and gender and continue to document how racial differences are created between women” (Crow: 37).

How education is delivered is important because the manifest function or intended purpose of formal education is knowledge, training students in reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as many other subjects. “Canadians spend much of their lives in classrooms,” affected by “a hidden curriculum, in our schools … where the latent function of education, the inculcation of values that, though not explicitly taught, form an inherent part of a school’s message” (Henslin: 71). The hidden message, are not good at nor found in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics https://www.ed.gov/stem ) classes compared to the Arts disciplines.
