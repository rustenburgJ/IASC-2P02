##  Bio (About me) 

•	I am a third-year student in Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University, in the Centre for Digital Humanities. I am studying solving problems through Interactive Arts and Science. Previously my studies included Computer Science (2003), Honours Sociology with a concentration in Social Justice and Equity (2010), Honours Women’s and Gender Studies (2015). These disciplines have provided tools and lenses for analysis from hard science and soft science perspectives as well as feminist perspectives.
•	My interests are social justice and equity, programming, Arduino, and I have a You Tube gaming channel. I volunteer making meals, serving and cleaning up for a Saturday Lunch Program in my community for low income and homeless people.

Blog
•	I first worked in UNIX when I was the help desk for a free net in the mid 1990s. The Internet was non-graphical at first and I worked using the command line to add users to the system, make help files to instruct business and residential clients. I configured how to connect to the Internet with various computers, modems, and software, and how to use/surf non-graphical Internet programs such as Archie, Veronica, and Lynx. I prorammed at the Windows command line (DOS) since 1988 and in Java since 1997 at school and on my G5 Powerbook, Macbooks, and Windows OS. I also use my two Linux OS computers.
