##   Tara McPherson: Why are the Digital Humanities so White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation
#### 2012 Print Edition 
###  A Traditional Critical Analysis and A DH Textual Analysis using Voyant Tools

Tara McPherson's question ["Why are the Digital Humanities so White?"](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/29) is the title of her article. McPherson argues that "the difficulties we encounter in knitting together our discussions of race (or other modes of difference) with our technological productions within the digital humanities (or in our studies of code) are actually an effect of the very designs of our technological systems, designs that emerged in post–World War II computational culture."  Why is McPherson's question so important? If the digital humanities (DH) are mostly white, then whose interests are serrved, what texts are investigated and published, what questions are asked and answered, whose research is done? If whites are heavily represented, then whose voice is heard, what data is skewed because of only a partial picture, what is the focus of DH work and who is oppressed by that? There is a danger of hegemony where the dominant group speaks for all. If there is a white vs. non-white perspective as McPherson discusses, there is a class distinction and a gendered perspective, male vs. female, or non-male, perspective as well. There is a particular class of people who attend university or college and go on to become the teachers and professors, researchers, who write the text books. There is a proportionately higher number of influential men in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields where UNIX and other operating systems originated as well as in the digital humanities. Digital humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities (Wikipedia).

McPherson's argument 'why' is a comparison structured by a lenticular lens, a parallel of two separate systems, first one and then the other, but never a mixture of the two. She shows historically, how over time situations changed and the two systems, UNIX operating system and the oppressive social system race, became harder to work from within for those affected.

   **Unix**    |   **Race**
  ---------------- | -------------------
  1969--beginning of UNIX | 1960s activism 
  operating system |  social system
  computer         |  people
  technical        |  humanities
  code studies | cultural and ethnic studies 

Her parallel structure is good for comparison as she talks about one concept, then the other, to compare how they bound their respective entities first in the mid 1960s and then much later on. McPherson's article is helpful to explain the point of view to each group from the perspective of the other group.

> Both the computer and the lenticular lens mediate images and objects, changing their relationship but frequently suppressing that process of relation, much like the divided departments of the contemporary university. The fragmentary knowledges encouraged by many forms and experiences of the digital neatly parallel the logics that underwrite the covert racism endemic to our times, operating in potential feedback loops, supporting each other. If scholars of race have highlighted how certain tendencies within poststructuralist theory simultaneously respond to and marginalize race, this maneuver is at least partially possible because of a parallel and increasing dispersion of electronic forms across culture, forms that simultaneously enact and shape their new modes of thinking (13). 

I use two types of academic analysis, the first is a traditional examination of the article by critically examining its arguments  and discussing its suggestions or conclusions. The second is by using a DH tool, [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/), to analyze the article and study statistics about it and my other two supporting articles Peggy MacIntosh's "_White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack"_ and Thomas Rommel's "_A Companion to Digital Humanities"_. I use my coursework in sociology, women's and gender studies, digital humanities, and programming experience from Computer Science and Mathematics to discuss UNIX.  


###  Traditional Analysis of Texts

#### Sociological Lens
Social scientists use a variety of techniques (e.g., surveys, experiments) to help them “see” the social world (Brym: 525). At first most [social scientists and policymakers] believed that the Internet would enhance equality of access to information by reducing its cost. As technoeuphoria wore off, however, observers noted that some kinds of people used the Internet more than others and that those with higher access also had greater access to education, income, and other resources that help people get ahead (DiMaggio: 549).
Higher education “has always been closely related to social-class background” (Brym: 328). At one Canadian university “students [e.g., women, Jews, Ukranians, Poles, Dutch, Norwegians, Germans, Italians, and Mennonites at the University of Manitoba] needed much higher marks than the “preferred” students [who] were Anglo-Celtic Protestant and Catholic (Brym: 329).
Conflict theory views society as a site of struggle between groups with different kinds and amounts of power and resources…Groups with more power are likely to control schooling and to impose their culture on it (Brym: 322).
_“Conflict analysis draws attention to the question of whose knowledge is reflected in schools, and which groups are served by the norms that schools foster” (Brym: 323). “Schools, like the society, are controlled by the relatively powerful, educational change depends on change in relations of power outside the school system” (Brym: 324).
Unequal power relations result in economic inequality, class difference, and dominance through schooling for people (Brym)._
"As the institutional means of power and the means of communications that tie them together have become steadily more efficient, those now in command of them have come into command of instruments of rule quite unsurpassed in the history of mankind" (Mills, 2007: 97). We see that schools are a powerful place that affect a person for life and in turn that person can have an effect on others. If a certain group of people have limited access to education and tools, then the full potential of the population cannot be reached. This is why McPherson's question is so important so this can change, DH can be inclusive not exclusive as it appears now.

####  Feminist Lens

**Race and Gender Inequalities--A Hierarchy of Race and Gender** 
“Humans … naturally favour members of their own ethnic or racial group—their ‘relatives’—and have a natural distrust and dislike of ‘nonfamily’ members” (Brym: 221).
“Power, prestige, and material well-being are often interrelated…historically, women have been excluded from certain types of activities that create opportunities for acquiring power, prestige, and wealth” (Brym: 190). 

**Feminism described as first, second, and third waves**  
McPherson uses a historical view and I include feminism in three waves in order to remind us of the connections of race, gender, technology, and the academy. The first wave of feminism (Henslin et al., 2007: 153) was the fight for the right to vote; the primary goal was the struggle to grant to vote to [certain women] _middle class women_, 1835-1920 (Crowe: 59, 60). The second wave of feminism, the rise of feminism in the mid 1960s along with other movements including the civil rights movement in the United States (Crow: 59). The third wave of feminism, late 1980s, 1990-1999 (Crow, 2009: 37, 59) brought out, uncovered, “the recognition that Canadian social institutions perpetuate racism” … and led to “epistemological questions of how to theorize the inter-connection between race and gender and continue to document how racial differences are created between women” (Crow: 37).

How education is delivered is important because the manifest function or intended purpose of formal education is knowledge, training students in reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as many other subjects. “Canadians spend much of their lives in classrooms,” affected by “a hidden curriculum, in our schools … where the latent function of education, the inculcation of values that, though not explicitly taught, form an inherent part of a school’s message” (Henslin: 71). The hidden message, women are not good at nor found in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Mathematics https://www.ed.gov/stem ) classes compared to the Arts disciplines. 

Structures responding to and marginalizing race -  For feminism, there is no one woman's story, but many stories, and class and race tell different stories for white and non-whites. The one/the other and the question is "Who benefits?" There is difference, the other is always in relation to the one, but the other can never be 'the one' unless we work together for change.

### Article Analysis, Comments on A Parallel Structure of UNIX and Race

Unix and race are separate entities which McPherson looks at through a lenticular lens. She uses a parallel structure to explain why the digital humanities are so white. 

- Structural separation

1. About UNIX. UNIX _embeds information_, hiding it from users of the system but transparent to creators of applications. The application programmers cordon off users from areas of the program they do not want users to see or access or change. It does so by modularity and use of shells.

2. About RACE. Our bodies _embody information_ such as race and culture. Judgements are made, e.g., by media, employers, according to visual representations. According to a structured hierarchy of white / other, where 'white' may be or is preferred and 'other' may or is not. The other are cordoned off and prevented from accessing jobs, services and/or programs that owners/managers of the system do not want them to access. 

3. A supporting document to McPherson, is Peggy McIntosh's _White Privilege, Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack_   [](https://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/white-privilege-essay-mcintosh.pdf) outlines the 
"_Privilege: an invisible package of unearned assets that I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was “meant” to remain oblivious"_. McIntosh writes a numbered list advantages of being white that come implicitly in an 'invisible knapsack' that she has taken for granted as a white person. She shines a spotlight on the white privilege that most [whites] take for granted and do not notice.
**List of Daily Effects of White Privilege**
[McIntosh - Daily Effects of White Privilege list](https://www.pcc.edu/resources/illumination/documents/white-privilege-essay-mcintosh.pdf) (page 2).
_"One factor seems clear about all of the interlocking oppressions. They take both active forms which we can see and embedded forms which as a member of the dominant group one is taught not to see"_ (McIntosh). McIntosh writes "There was one main piece of cultural turf: it was my own turf, and I was among those who could control the turf." This is the problem, control. As I wrote previously, who benefits? The controlling group control the turf and whether they recognize it or not this means perpetual barriers for non-whites. 

4. Why were the digital humanities so white, sheds light on why are the 1% still so white? The system supports itself, 'the master's tools' are white, the system, as McPherson points out, is structured so that it feeds the white and stifles the other, first overtly before the mid 1960s then covertly after that. White, upper class, educated men have the privilege to continue the system more easily than others. Efforts made to change the system happened. In the mid 1960s there were race riots and the second wave of feminism to counter act that male system of privilege. This is a political subject as those who controlled the Internet and early computers were the government and the military. The government still controls schools and education and the military. Who controls the media and networks but corporations who pay for air time through commercials and advertisements. Who controlled the government, education, and corporations but white, upper class, educated men.

5. Changes came about from second wave feminism, to work toward gender equality and third wave feminism in the early 1990s brought many aspects including action and support for women of colour. Feminism could push back against inequity. People needed to recognize inequity and that is why I have included Peggy McIntosh's paper on _White Privilege, Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack._ The goal is to break down the barriers to allow inclusion in the Digital Humanities, academia, or elsewhere. It must be done by those in control.

#### A Historical Look, Pre UNIX

I studied assembly language on a Von Neumann machine/processor, with do-it-yourself data structures carved out, with SAL, MAL, and TAL (True Assembly Language). One could argue that programming in assembly was complicated in that it required keeping track of the space used, being careful not to overwrite areas by keeping the data structures in the program 'segregated' manually in the program. One could also argue that it was simple, transparent, and hands-on.

#### UNIX and mid 1960s

The operating system Unix overtook Von Neumann's machine programmed with asssembly language. UNIX had shells and used modularity, making it less open and accessible than previous opreating systems programmed with assembly language. 

  **Unix**   |        **Race**
  ------ | -----------------------------
  modular |  overt racism
  shell   |  segregation

#### Late 1990s

**Unix, Java** |       **Race**
------------ | --------------------------------
modular |  covert racism
OOP |  feedback loops further racism
classes | classes




### Analysis with Digital Humanities (DH) and Voyant Text Analysis tools

As Thomas Rommel writes, 
> The history of literary computing, however, shows that only a limited number of textual phenomena can be analyzed profitably in the context of quantitative and qualitative computer-based analyses of style. These phenomena have to be linked to some surface features that can be identified by electronic means, usually by some form of pattern matching. Computers are exceptionally well suited for this kind of analysis, and only human intuition and insight, in combination with the raw computing power of machines programmed to act as highly specialized electronic tools, can make some texts or textual problems accessible to scholars.

In summary, we have read about both sides through the lenticular parallel structure, programmers and technical people would recognize the separation of operating system and applications run on the system from users. Feminism makes us aware that the personal and the political are separate spheres; laws are made in the public sphere and can be changed there, e.g., segregation which separated people by color and race. Social justice workers work to break these barriers from inside and outside the system. Feminism is for everyone, not just for a certain class of white women. Women's and gender studies coursework helps to identify axes of oppression, e.g., race, class, gender, and to work out a plan to change those things for the better. 

McPherson discusses the mid 1960s, and later connected to certain events. Peggy McIntosh has broken the ice, spoken out, raised awareness  by writing to the educated in a recognizable way, to open the eyes of 'other white people,' many who are unaware that their smooth path has obstacles for others who are non-white. She calls attention to and gives examples of what she can do that many non-whites cannot. Other people, white people, need to become aware. McPherson makes points in a different way than McIntosh has. 
McPherson speaks to a broad audience and uses a DH analysis using computational tools, UNIX operating system and compares it to the racial system. McIntosh uses a humanities, academic essay approach, perhaps only seen by academics and students. 

Finally, the obstacles need to be removed, entrance for non-white students into DH, and this work is not done until there is no longer the question "Why are the digital humanities so white?"
